# Udacity fullstack nanodegree project 3

This repository's `catalog` directory contains the modified contents of the [udacity fullstack nanodegree](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm/tree/master/vagrant) repo's `vagrant/catalog` directory.  After [installing vagrant](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud197/install-vagrant), replace that repository's `catalog` directory with the one contained here.

To run the project, execute `python run.py` from the `catalog` directory, optionally running `python capp/lotsofitems.py` first to prepopulate the database with some sample data.

For Google login, save the JSON file from the [Google developers console](https://console.developers.google.com/) APIs & auth > Credentials screen as `client_secrets.json` in the `catalog` directory.
